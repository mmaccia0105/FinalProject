    "text": "Diabetes is a significant chronic medical condition which is becoming more and more prevalent in the United States. When people develop diabetes, they cannot regulate their blood glucose normally, which leads to reduced quality of life. When diabetes is not controlled, through diet and exercise, it can lead to additional medical problems. The main mechanism by which diabetes occurs, is that in a normal body, insulin is used to break down sugars from food into energy. In patients with diabetes, insulin is either not produced or does not work as normal leading to increase blood glucose. There are 2 types of diabetes.\n\nType 1 is normally genetic and the body does not produce insulin\nType 2 is normally developed throughout life and while the body may produce insulin, it does not work as it should\n\nAdditionally, diabetes can lead to cardiovascular and kidney complications. Also, patients are at risk for poor eyesight and wound healing.\nDiabetes continues to increase with upwards of 34 million people with diabetes and upwards of 88 million with pre-diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is really the version of concern, since its prevalence varies by age, education level, income status, location, race, and many other Social Drivers of Health (SDOH)."

It has been conducted every year since 1984 and targets over 400,000 Americans. This data we will focus on is from the 2015 survey of 441,455 individuals with 330 feature.\nThe specific dataset to explore is titled diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv.\nThis specific set is of 253,680 responses. Here, the target variable is Diabetes_binary where 0 indicates no diabetes and 1 indicates the presence of diabetes or prediabetes. Overall, there are 21 variables."

As a pharmacist, I know how the affect of some of these variables would affect someone’s development of prediabetes and diabetes. Diet and exercise are some of the most important factors that a patient has direct control of, which can either lower or increase their risk of development of diabetes. As a result, I chose whether or not the subject has physical activity to indicate whether or not they live a sedentary lifestyle. Then I decided on their vegetable and alcohol consumption as addition variables to consider. If a patient increased their vegetable intake and / or decreased alcohol intake, they likely can reduce their risk of diabetes. Finally, I did choose BMI as a 4th variable. This is another factor a patient has control over and can lead to diabetes if they have higher BMIs. I also wanted at least 1 variable to be more than just binary, so BMI will be later converted to categories."

We want to examine our chosen variables to see if maybe visualize some relationships between the variables. Before modeling our data, we can also visualize some summary statistics to understand the composition of our subjects from this survey.\nAfter, we would then want to evaluate some different models, to identify the best one that can be used to predict if someone has prediabetes or diabetes. Different models will be evaluated since we want to create one that is accurate and is able to perform well on new data we provide, for example a different year of the survey. Ideally, a fit model would have lower error metrics and high accuracy."

Unfortunately all of the variables are number, but really the majority are binary. Since we are only going to evaluate a few of the variables from the survey, the next step will be to select out those variables and do some manipulation on them alone.\n\ndiabetes_data_selected &lt;- diabetes_data |&gt; \n  select(Diabetes_binary, BMI, Veggies, PhysActivity, HvyAlcoholConsump)\n\nstr(diabetes_data_selected)\n\ntibble [253,680 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Diabetes_binary  : num [1:253680] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ...\n $ BMI              : num [1:253680] 40 25 28 27 24 25 30 25 30 24 ...\n $ Veggies          : num [1:253680] 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 ...\n $ PhysActivity     : num [1:253680] 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 ...\n $ HvyAlcoholConsump: num [1:253680] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n\n\nNow to make the data more readable, we will convert the variables to factors.

I thought the presence of prediabetes or diabetes in this survey would’ve been higher.\n\n\nDoes the subject eat vegetables?\n\ndiabetes_summarize |&gt; \n  count(veggies) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  veggies      n percent\n  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No       47839    18.9\n2 Yes     205841    81.1\n\n\nThis is not necessarily surprising that the majority eat vegetables at least 1 time per day. Based on the information provided, it does not quantify a certain amount, just 1 time.\n\n\nDoes the subject perform physical activity?\n\ndiabetes_summarize |&gt; \n  count(exercise) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  exercise      n percent\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No        61760    24.4\n2 Yes      191920    75.6\n\n\nThis is physical activity within 30 days. Similar to vegetables, it does not quantify, so these numbers make sense. I imagine if it asked more than 5 - 10 times a month, or at least 150 minutes per week, then the percent “Yes” would likely decline.\n\n\nPresence of Excessive Alcohol Use\n\ndiabetes_summarize |&gt; \n  count(alcohol_use) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  alcohol_use      n percent\n  &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No          239424   94.4 \n2 Yes          14256    5.62\n\n\nThis amount who drink excessively is not surprising. This variable actually quantifies things better than the previous 2.\n\n\nSummary of BMI Categories\n\ndiabetes_summarize |&gt; \n  count(bmi) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  bmi                 n percent\n  &lt;ord&gt;           &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Underweight      3127    1.23\n2 Healthy Weight  68953   27.2 \n3 Overweight      93749   37.0 \n4 Class 1 Obesity 53451   21.1 \n5 Class 2 Obesity 22921    9.04\n6 Severe Obesity  11479    4.52\n\n\n\nggplot(diabetes_summarize, aes(bmi, fill = bmi))+\n         geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"BMI Category\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       title = \"Frequency of BMI by Category\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a nice distribution of BMI categories. The lower level of diabetes in the overall population would tell me that overall the BMIs should rather normal (Healthy Weight/Overweight). I think the overweight range of &gt; 25 to 30 kg/m^2 BMI is not the greatest label set by the CDC.\n\n\nBar Graphs to Visual Proportions of Some Categorizations\nNow that we have looked at each variable separately let’s look at some frequencies of people with and without diabetes in some of the categories. For this one, let’s look at diabetes frequency based on physical activity, heavy alcohol use, and BMI cateogory. Will exclude vegetable consumption here since a large majority of subjects consume them.\n\ndiabetes_exercise &lt;- diabetes_summarize |&gt; \n  count(diabetes, exercise) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))\n\ndiabetes_exercise\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n  diabetes exercise      n percent\n  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No       No        48701   19.2 \n2 No       Yes      169633   66.9 \n3 Yes      No        13059    5.15\n4 Yes      Yes       22287    8.79\n\nggplot(diabetes_exercise, aes(x = diabetes, y = percent, fill = exercise)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(percent, \"%\")),\n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),\n            vjust = -0.3, size = 4) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Diabetes\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    title = \"Physical Activity by Diabetes\",\n    fill = \"Physical Activity within 30 Days\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"green\", \"Yes\" = \"yellow\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think looking at this graph, I am not sure this helps to figure out whether physical activity is associated with the absence of diabetes. In patients without, it is clear a large majority have physical activity within the past 30 days. When looking at subjects with diabetes, more did have physical activity then did not. As stated before, since this is not really quantifed as more than just physical activity within 30 days, it may not be as helpful as something that quantifies better.\n\ndiabetes_alcohol_use &lt;- diabetes_summarize |&gt; \n  count(diabetes, alcohol_use) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))\n\ndiabetes_alcohol_use\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n  diabetes alcohol_use      n percent\n  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No       No          204910   80.8 \n2 No       Yes          13424    5.29\n3 Yes      No           34514   13.6 \n4 Yes      Yes            832    0.33\n\nggplot(diabetes_alcohol_use, aes(x = diabetes, y = percent, fill = alcohol_use)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(percent, \"%\")),\n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),\n            vjust = -0.3, size = 4) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Diabetes\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    title = \"Alcohol Use by Presence or Absence of Diabetes\",\n    fill = \"Heavy Alcohol Use\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"orange\", \"Yes\" = \"blue\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there was minimal heavy alcohol use within this population, this graph may not tell us much. There is overall a small percentage of heavy alcohol use in the diabetes group.\n\ndiabetes_bmi_cat &lt;- diabetes_summarize |&gt; \n  count(diabetes, bmi) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))\n\ndiabetes_bmi_cat\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 4\n   diabetes bmi                 n percent\n   &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;ord&gt;           &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 No       Underweight      2958    1.17\n 2 No       Healthy Weight  65025   25.6 \n 3 No       Overweight      83057   32.7 \n 4 No       Class 1 Obesity 43170   17.0 \n 5 No       Class 2 Obesity 16528    6.52\n 6 No       Severe Obesity   7596    2.99\n 7 Yes      Underweight       169    0.07\n 8 Yes      Healthy Weight   3928    1.55\n 9 Yes      Overweight      10692    4.21\n10 Yes      Class 1 Obesity 10281    4.05\n11 Yes      Class 2 Obesity  6393    2.52\n12 Yes      Severe Obesity   3883    1.53\n\nggplot(diabetes_bmi_cat, aes(x = bmi, y = percent, fill = diabetes)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(percent, \"%\")),\n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),\n            vjust = -0.3, size = 4) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"BMI Category\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    title = \"Diabetes Presence by BMI Category\",\n    fill = \"Diabetes Status\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_discrete() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, when looking at the percent of subjects within each BMI category, there are higher proportions of subjects with diabetes in the higher BMI categories.\n\n\nScatter Plot to Visual Diabetes Probability based on BMI\nFinally, lets look at a few scatter plots to see if we can visual some relationships a bit better than just the bar graphs.\n\n#need to convert BMI to numeric. Also need to take the diabetes factor and convert to numeric for\n#plotting reasons\nggplot(diabetes_summarize, aes(x = as.numeric(bmi), y = as.numeric(diabetes == \"Yes\"))) + \n  #plot a logistic line below\n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\", method.args = list(family = \"binomial\"), se = FALSE) +\n  #creating our bmi categories as numeric for better plotting\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:6, labels = levels(diabetes_summarize$bmi)) +\n  labs(title = \"Probability of Diabetes by BMI Category\",\n       x = \"BMI Category\",\n       y = \"Probability of Diabetes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graphs help with some of our modeling ideas. Plotting a logistic line comparing the probability of having diabetes based on BMI category, as BMI increases, the likelihood of diabetes increases, which makes sense."
